# RISCV-32_RARS_Simulator
A RISCV-32 RARS Simulator Using C++. Done By: Maya Hussein, Merna Abdelbadie, Farah Fathy


Assumptions made:
1. Register data structure decimal values and the memory stores stores binary values and worked accordingly.
2. Memory is byte addressable

Any Bugs or issues in the simulator:
No bugs in the simulator.

User guide:
How to compile and run:
1. Change the directory in line 115 for assembly code file
Line 165 for register file that contains initial values
Line 189 for program data file

2. The user is required to enter the starting address. Then the program will go through the
assembly code and change in the memory and register value and output them after each
instruction.
